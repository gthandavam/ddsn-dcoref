Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) solver,
in pure Python.

This project provides pure Python code for searching sub-optimal solutions to the TSP. 
Additionally, utility scripts for visualization of results are provided.

Solver library does not requires any libraries, utility scripts require:
 - Numpy
 - PIL (Python imageing library)
 - Matplotlib

Libraries:
 src/greedy_tsp.py : The TSP solver library
 src/image2point_cloud.py : Utility library, used by tsp.py

Applications (run them with Python and add option -h or --help)
 src/tsp.py : Test application. Generates TSP solutions for random problems.
 src/pickle2svg.py : Visualization appliation, converts solution files, produced by tsp.py to the SVG vector images.
